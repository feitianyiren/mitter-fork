  feature: status icon popup menu (right-click), currently
     only few actions, should have more in future.

  backport: get ./check from 1.0.0alpha1, to comb source
     with pyflakes and PEP8 Python Style Guide

  fix: ui_pygtk cleaning up according to ./check

  mitter-fork: Created new fork from stable mitter 0.4.5

     be fixed, though it looks a lot of work. In the
     meantime, some features can be added to this fork.
  feature: _in_reply_to_id referencing
